As we can see in the nmap scan results, that we have `.git` directory present. We can use `git-dumper` to dump the complete source code
It can be downloaded using `pip install git-dumper`.<br>

Dumping all the source -
```bash
git-dumper http://10.10.11.58/ git_files
```

![source files](/images/dog_sourcecode.png)

After going through the PHP files, found a credential in `settings.php`
![credential](/images/dog_creds.png)

Visited the website running on port 80, and tried the creds in the login page with some common usernames like - `admin`, `dog`, `administrator`, but none of them worked.<br>
![loginpage](/images/dog_loginpage.png)

Started enumeration further. There were many JSON files in the `/files/config_83dddd18e1ec67fd8ff5bba2453c7fb3/active` directory. Began catting the content of the JSON files that looked interesting, but it was taking a long time. So grepped for `dog.htb` to see if we can find any username/email.

![jsonfiles](/images/dog_jsonfiles.png)
![tiffany](/images/dog_tiffany.png)

And hence found a username, that we can try in the login page.<br>
The credentials successfully worked, and we were logged in as admin into the CMS platform.<br>
![admin access](/images/dog_adminaccess.png)

As the CMS is `backdrop CMS`, looked up for any publicly availabe exploits, and found an interesting exploit, that we can look into.
![searchsploit](/images/dog_searchsploit.png)

Went through the code of the exploit, and found that it is basically generating a malicious module for remote code execution as a .zip file, which we can upload from the web app.<br>
Ran the exploit and got the malicious `.zip` file to be uploaded.
![running exploit](/images/dog_runningexploit.png)

Now, we can try uploading the zip file, in the location as specified.
![manual installation](/images/dog_manualinstall.png)
![allowed extension](/images/dog_allowedext.png)

We can see, that our zip file wasn't accepted, we can generate a `.tar` file instead.<br>
As we saw, after running the exploit, it also created a directory named `shell`. So we can create a .tar archive out of it.

![tar archive](/images/dog_tararchive.png)

Now, on uploading, it got accepted, and we can go to the location `/modules/shell/shell.php` for executing commands
![successful installation](/images/dog_installsuccess.png)

Then got a system rev shell from the webshell.
![getting shell](/images/dog_gettingshell.png)
![getting shell](/images/dog_gettingshell1.png)

We can see, got access as `www-data`.<br>
From here, we can see what users are there, and perform further enumeration, to gain access to a higher privilege acccount.<br>
I tried the credential that we got earlier against the users in the system and successfully got access to `johncusack` account.

![userflag](/images/dog_userflag.png)

And hence got the user flag.<br>
As we know the pass of `johncusack` account, we can just SSH into the account from here, to get a stable shell.
![ssh](/images/dog_ssh.png)

Doing further enumeration - 
![run as sudo](/images/dog_runassudo.png)

We can see that the user `johncusack` can run `/usr/local/bin/bee` (Bee is a command line utility for Backdrop CMS) as root. 
Looking into the binary, we see, that we can do plenty of operations. For example, we can list the users. We would need to set the global option with the command for it to work.

![running bee](/images/dog_runningbee.png)

We can use the `eval` command, as that is of our interest to execute a PHP command.
![eval](/images/dog_beeeval.png)

![root](/images/dog_rootflag.png)

Executed the eval statement and got root, though for some reason the shell wasn't working properly and was not giving any results for any commands, so took a rev shell, and got the root flag.
